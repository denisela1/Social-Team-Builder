# Social-Team-Builder
Build a full-blown Python web application in this Capstone project. 
The Django site lets users add projects, signup for team projects, and control who has access to which projects. 
Include a user registration system which lets users signup and login.

It's time to build a single, large project that pull everything together!

You've decided to start a small side project to scratch your own itch. 
Sometimes it's really hard to find people to help you with projects or projects that could benefit from 
your particular set of skills. 
No, not tracking down smugglers, but coding, designing, writing, and other programming-related talents.

You're going to build a site where people can sign up to find projects that need help or post their own projects 
for other people to join. 
Users should be able to create a brief profile for themselves after they sign up with an avatar, a bio, and 
pick their skills from a list. 
Users can post a project, too, giving it a title and description. 
They should also list the positions they need filled for that job with a brief description of what the position will be 
responsible for. 
Users should be able to find a project and ask to join it. 
If you're a project owner, you can approve or deny the person asking to join. 
Finally, make sure you have login and logout links, too.
